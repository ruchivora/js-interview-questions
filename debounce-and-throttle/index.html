                Debouncing is a programming technique used to control how often
                a function is executed, particularly when the event triggering 
                the function happens frequently in a short time span.
            </b>

            <p style="padding-top:20px">
                In this example, we have a button that tracks two things when clicked:

                Number of times the button is clicked: Each time the button is clicked, 
                a counter increments to reflect the total number of times the button was pressed.<p>
            </p>
            <p>
                Number of times the debounced function is executed: Debouncing ensures that only one 
                function execution happens within a certain time period, even if the button is 
                clicked multiple times in quick succession. 
            </p>

            <p>
                The second counter tracks how many 
                times the function is actually executed, ignoring the rapid clicks that occur within 
                the debounce delay.
            </p>

                
            <p>
                How it works:
                Every click increments the clickCount counter.
                However, if clicks happen too frequently (within the debounce delay), 
                they won't trigger the function immediately. Only after the user pauses 
                clicking for a specific delay does the function execute, incrementing 
                the debounceCount.
            </p>

            Throttling is a technique used to limit the execution
            of a function to once every specified interval, 
            regardless of how often the event is triggered. 

            <p>In this example, we have a button that tracks two things when clicked:</p>
            
            <p>
                Number of times the button is clicked: This counter increments each time the button is pressed, 
                reflecting the total number of user clicks.
            </p>
                
            <p>
                Number of times the throttled function is executed: Throttling ensures that the function is executed 
                once after a specified time interval, regardless of how many times the button is 
                clicked during that interval.
